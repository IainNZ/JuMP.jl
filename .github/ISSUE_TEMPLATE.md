If you have a question or are unsure if the behavior you're experiencing is a bug,
please search or post to our Discourse site: https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt. We use
the GitHub issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests only.

If the bug you're experiencing is solver-specific (e.g., it only happens when you use Gurobi),
the issue is best raised at the relevent solver-wrapper repository. If you are unsure, you should
raise the problem on Discourse.

If you've confirmed that the behaviour is a bug, and it relates to JuMP, this is the right place.
Be sure to include as much relevant information as possible, including a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

Thanks for contributing to JuMP!
