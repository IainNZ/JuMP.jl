# How to contribute to JuMP

Welcome! This document explains some of the ways you can contribute to JuMP.

## Join the Discourse forum

First up, join the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt).

The forum is a good place to ask questions about how to use JuMP. You can also
use the forum to discuss possible feature requests and bugs before raising a
Github issue (more on this below).

Aside from asking questions, the easiest way you can contribute to JuMP is to
help answer questions on Discourse!

## File a bug report

Another way to contribute to JuMP is to file [bug reports](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

Before you do however, make sure you read the following before posting a new bug
report:

- If you have a question or are unsure if the behavior you're experiencing is a
  bug, please search or post to our [Discourse site](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt).
  Questions posted to Discourse have broader visibility and are likely to be
  answered more quickly than Github issues.

- If you're experiencing a bug that is solver-specific (e.g., it only happens
  when you use Gurobi), the issue is best raised at the relevant solver-wrapper
  repository (e.g., [Gurobi.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Gurobi.jl)). If you
  are unsure, you should raise the problem on Discourse first.

- If you are reasonably confident your issue is a bug in JuMP, opening a [Github issue]((https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/issues/new?template=bug_report.md))
  is the right step. Be sure to include as much relevant information as
  possible, including a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
  (See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
  for background on how to format text and code on GitHub issues.)

Thanks for contributing to JuMP!
