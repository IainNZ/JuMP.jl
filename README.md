JuMP
====
#### Julia for Mathematical Programming

JuMP is a domain-specific modeling language for **[mathematical programming]**
embedded in **[Julia]**. It currently supports a number of open-source and
commercial solvers ([COIN Clp], [COIN Cbc], [GNU GLPK], [Gurobi], [MOSEK], [CPLEX]) via a 
[generic solver-independent interface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl). 

One the best features of JuMP is its **speed** - benchmarking has shown that it
can create problems at similar speeds to special-purpose modeling languages
such as AMPL while maintaining the expressiveness of a generic high-level 
programming language. JuMP communicates with solvers in-memory, 
avoiding the need to write intermediary files and enabling access to **advanced
features** such as efficient LP re-solves and callbacks for mixed-integer programming.

JuMP has recently enabled support for nonlinear programming for functions that can be expressed in closed algebraic form. JuMP computes exact sparse second-order derivatives needed by efficient interior-point solvers. Currently, [Ipopt] is the only supported solver, with more coming soon. 

Our documentation includes an installation guide, quick-start guide, and reference manual.
