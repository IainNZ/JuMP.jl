Constraints
===========

DRAFT: Describe how constraints are represented (link to MOI docs). Constraints
are very similar to variables in (1) how names work (2) how attributes work, and
(3) the macro syntax for constructing them. They're a bit different because
they're parameterized by function-set type. Describe constraints vs.
`ConstraintRefs`. Describe `JuMP.constraintobject`. How to delete constraints.
How to modify constraints by setting attributes and `MOI.modifyconstraint!`.
Describe semidefinite constraints and symmetry handling. Refer to NLP docs for
nonlinear constraints.
