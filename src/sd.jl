Return a `VectorConstraint` of shape [`SymmetricMatrixShape`](@ref) constraining
the matrix `Q` to be positive semidefinite.

This function is used by the [`@variable`](@ref) macro to create a symmetric
semidefinite matrix of variables and by the [`@constraint`](@ref) macros as
follows:
```julia
@constraint(model, Symmetric(Q) in PSDCone())
```
The form above is usually used when the entries of `Q` are affine or quadratic
expressions but it can also be used when the entries are variables to get the
reference of the semidefinite constraint, e.g.,
```julia
@variable model Q[1:2,1:2] Symmetric
# The type of `Q` is `Symmetric{VariableRef, Matrix{VariableRef}}`
var_psd = @constraint model Q in PSDCone()
# The `var_psd` variable contains a reference to the constraint
```
